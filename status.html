<h1>Status</h1>

<h2>June, 2016</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Updating the code to run in the current version of the language has been more challenging than expected (of course).  In particular, the original paper uses non-linear systems methods applied to Euler equations to solve the problems of agents (firms and households).  The methods are not robust to starting values and the published solutions required a lot of work not inherent in the code.</li>
  <li>As this project grew out of an undergraduate course the student team members faced a very short deadline.  They completed their <a href="./StudentProject" targe="content">course project</a> by writing code that solves the basic problem without many of the extensions that affect robustness of the algorithm.</li>
  <li>The code is now being re-written in the open-source object-oriented platform <a href="https://github.com/ferrall/niqlow"   target="_blank">niqlow</a>.</li>
  <li>The project does not incorporate any data (open or otherwise).  The goal is to integrate global temperature, emissions and economic data into a platform.</li>
