<h1>Objective</h1>

The overall goal of this project is to create an interactive website that allows users to explore the long-term implications of climate change and economic policy changes in response to climate change.</p>

Specifically, the project seeks to implement  <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069608000776">Leach (2008)</a> which presents a stylized model of the world economy that affects and is affected by climate change through greenhouse gas emissions and temperature impacts on productivity.  The effect of alternative economic policy responses on welfare (in the technical economic sense) is considered.</p>

The strategy is:
 <ul>
   <li>Update Leach's code that solves the model, then extend it to account for other policies.</li>
   <li>Create a web interface that allows for remote setting of parameters of policy experiments</li>
   <li>Integrate updated temperature and economic data used in the analysis.</li>
   <li>Add other <em>integrated assessment models</em>.</li>
 </ul>
 
<H2>Background</H2> 

Any policy response designed to address anthropogenic climate change must be global in scope in order to have a measurable effect.  Any prediction for the costs and benefits of a response must account for very long term effects on the order of decades as well as how individual agents (households and firms) respond and effect changes in market prices.  Economics has various types of models to study dynamic decisions as well as to prediction the impact of people within and across generations.</p>
  
The only feasible way to solve somewhat realistic models of climate change policy is numerically. Peer-reviewed work on such models exist, but the value of most of it work is frozen at the time of publication.  No method is made available to use the published model for purposes such as: simulations of alternative policies that are proposed; update of parameter values as new data are released; validation of predictions out of sample; extensions and modifications of the model in a collaborative way.</p>

Our project aims to use resources of Compute Canada in order to overcome these limitations. There are many hurdles to achieve the goal.  Software development and data analysis are among them, but so is a lack of skills.  Using the Human Dimensions Challenge to engage students to bridge the gap between economic models and computational methods they require.  </p>
