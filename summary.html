<h1>Objective</h1>

The overall goal of this project is to create an interactive website that allows users to explore the long-term implications of climate change and economic policy changes in response to climate change.</p>

Specifically, the project seeks to implement  <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069608000776">Leach (2008)</a> which presents a stylized model of the world economy that affects and is affected by climate change through greenhouse gas emissions and temperature impacts on productivity.  The effect of alternative economic policy responses on welfare (in the technical economic sense) is considered.</p>

The strategy is:
 <ul>
   <li>Update Leach's code that solves the model, then extend it to account for other policies.</li>
   <li>Create a web interface that allows for remote setting of parameters of policy experiments</li>
   <li>Integrate updated temperature and economic data used in the analysis.</li>
   <li>Add other <em>integrated assessment models</em>.</li>
 </ul>
